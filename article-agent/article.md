Overview

This briefing summarizes major developments in India from the Indian Express live updates (Dec 8–9, 2025). Items are grouped by national significance, transport and safety, law and politics, and regional stories.

Top stories

1) North Goa nightclub fire — major casualties and investigation
- A fire at the Birch by Romeo Lane nightclub in Arpora, North Goa, resulted in heavy casualties. A technical evaluation found deficiencies in fire-safety infrastructure and unauthorised hazardous external activities contributed to the severity. The incident has prompted police and investigative coordination; reports note 25 people dead and multiple injured.

2) IndiGo operational crisis continues to disrupt travel
- Widespread cancellations and disruptions at IndiGo have affected passengers across cities. The crisis raised questions about airline board oversight; the airline’s board reportedly met early in the disruption and received a management briefing. Airports and courts are seeing related petitions and complaints (refunds, passenger rights).

3) Luthra brothers and Goa club ownership developments
- Police say the Luthra brothers, owners of the Goa club where the blaze occurred, left for Thailand hours after the fire. Authorities are coordinating with Interpol/CBI to locate and apprehend them.

4) Enforcement Directorate chargesheet in DJB case

Context and next steps
