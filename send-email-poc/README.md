# Requirements
1. Application should be able to send email
2. We have multiple applications
3. We know below Providers, explore and implement send email functionality
> 1. Sendgrid 
> 2. Amazon SES

# Deliverables
1. Develop a application where we can play with functionality which send a email
2. Also document details like setup in application and in proivder. Basically if a new application want to integrate email functionality then this documentation should help
3. Also have a a design diagram - Example, how this email flow works. Meaning UI send a request to backend, then BE talk with a email provider(SMTP) etc.. 
4. A demo video/screen recording - this recording we save it in different place, not in this repository

Note: As this is public repository, don't push SMTP details or any sensitive information to public. Example: SMTP details should be external configurable 


# Example use case for email
1. Welcome email
> 1. Subject: Welcome to Sorted stream
> 2. Body: Greeting and some introduction about stream and signature
> 3. Sender email: For this experiment you can use any email
> 4. Receiver email: You can use your email
