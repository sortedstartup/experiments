                This design follows a <strong>minimalist corporate aesthetic</strong>, which is clean, professional, and easy to scan. The use of ample white space ensures that the user's attention is drawn to the most important details: the job title, company, and call-to-action (Apply Now).

                The <strong>hierarchy of information</strong> is clear, with the job title and company name prominently displayed at the top. The salary range is placed at the bottom-right, as it is a key decision-making factor but not the primary focus. The tags for skills are subtle but visible, allowing users to quickly assess if they meet the requirements.

                The <strong>hover effect</strong> (shadow growth) adds interactivity and feedback, making the card feel dynamic without overwhelming the user. This variant is ideal for corporate job portals where professionalism and clarity are paramount.

                This design uses a <strong>bold and high-contrast</strong> approach, with a black background and bright accent colors (e.g., Netflix's signature red). This creates a striking visual impact that immediately draws attention, making it ideal for companies with strong brand identities.

                The <strong>call-to-action button</strong> is designed to stand out with a bright red color, which is Netflix's brand color.

        <!-- UX Thinking for Variant 5 -->
        <div class="bg-gray-50 p-6 rounded-lg">
            <h3 class="text-lg font-bold text-gray-900 mb-2">Variant 5: Interactive Card with Expandable Details</h3>
            <p class="text-gray-700">
                This variant introduces <strong>interactivity</strong> to the job card, allowing users to expand and collapse details as needed. This is particularly useful for job listings with lengthy descriptions or multiple sections, as it prevents overwhelming the user with too much information upfront.
                <br /><br />
                The <strong>progressive disclosure</strong> pattern ensures that the card remains clean and scannable while still providing access to all the necessary details. The chevron icon provides a visual cue that the card is interactive, and the smooth transition effect enhances the user experience.
                <br /><br />
                This design is ideal for <strong>complex or senior roles</strong> where additional context (e.g., responsibilities, qualifications) is critical for candidates to assess their fit. It balances simplicity with depth, making it suitable for both quick scans and in-depth reviews.
